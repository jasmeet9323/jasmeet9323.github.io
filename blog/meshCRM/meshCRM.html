                <h2>How to mesh an airplane wing surface</h2>
                <p>
                    Before getting into the details, let's define what is a mesh.
                </p>
                <p style="padding: 1em;">
                    A <b>mesh</b> is a geometrical discretization of a domain that consists of (a) a collection
                    of mesh entities of controlled size and distribution and (b) topological
                    relationships or adjacencies forming the graph of the mesh. The mesh covers the domain with neither
                    overlaps nor holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve for the flow over an airplane wing computationally, one has to define a volume mesh of the
                    domain. The volume mesh needs a surface mesh to serve as its starting point. Hence, generating a
                    surface mesh is the first step towards generating a valid volume mesh. In my
                    <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0389973">
                        master's thesis</a>, I developed a method to generate quadrilateral dominant anisotropic mesh
                    automatically using an input surface triangulation. In this blog post, I write the subroutines I use
                    to develop such a mesh.

                <h3>Geometry Import</h3>
                <p>
                    Usually, the surface mesh generation algorithm needs a geometrical representation of the solid body
                    that
                    is required to be meshed. Representing solid bodies as a collection of their <i>boundaries</i> (<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation">B-Rep</a>) is quite common. Hence,
                    solid bodies are represented by the elements which form these boundaries. For example, a cube may be
                    stored as a collection of six squares which form it. For complex three dimenstional bodies, such as the
                    wing of an airplane, it is common to use small triangular elements to represent it.
