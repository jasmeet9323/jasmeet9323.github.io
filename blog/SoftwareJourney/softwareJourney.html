                <h2>My journey to Software Engineering, as a Mechanical Engineer</h2>
                <p>
                    As you can tell from the title, this is my story of becoming a Software Engineer while holding two
                    Mechanical Engineering degrees. I write this story because I think that someone who is reading this
                    might learn from what I did, or from what I didn't do in the process. The field of Software
                    Engineering is expanding since the last 35 odd years and would continue to do so. Who could have
                    thought that a majority of the workforce would be working remotely from their homes in 2020? Yet,
                    this was made possible by the internet and by the software churned out by this industry. People from
                    other fields, who are interested to be a part of this ever-evolving revolution keep questioning
                    their abilities. Hence, this blog post for me is a way I give an example path to anyone interested
                    in writing software and working in this wonderful filed of work, but might not be very sure of how
                    to do it. Or, maybe you just want to know my story. In any case, let's get started.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was thinking of how to put my story into a cogent blog post. Then, I thought of an analogy. My
                    journey of venturing into software development could be thought of as a seed growing into a tree.
                    Throughout the process of growth of a tree, there are several important steps that it takes. First,
                    the roots have to develop deep and strong enough into the soil so that it can support the trunk of
                    the tree. Then, the trunk would grow taller and wider. It would hold all the branches of the tree.
                    The branches are next in the line, they grow far and wide to cover more and more real estate in the
                    tree's neighborhood to get more sunlight for its leaves. Lastly, the tree is ready to bear fruit.
                </p>

                <h3>Roots</h3>

                <p>
                    I enrolled at IIT (BHU), Varanasi, India for a four-year bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering
                    in 2011. I know that this sounds more like the fruit of the tree than the roots. But, for this story,
                    this was my root. In the four years that I was at IIT Varanasi, I developed and retained analytical
                    thinking skills from my course work. Differential and Integral Calculus, Differential Equations,
                    Numerical Methods, Probability, and Statistics, these were some of the courses that I took during my
                    undergraduate years. Apart from these math courses, almost each of my courses in Mechanical
                    Engineering involved some sort of Mathematics. Thermodynamics had some form of theoretical
                    mathematics while Operations Research involved some form of combinatorics. I met with the best minds
                    of India at my campus and interacted with them while working on several curricular and
                    non-curricular projects. My projects ranged from building a line following robot to building a
                    full-fledged All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), with handmade manual transmission. This gave me an edge over
                    most in terms of critical thinking and problem-solving. The roots of the tree were starting to grip
                    the soil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I did internships in a couple of distinct industries. One was at a Thermal Power Plant, while the
                    other was at a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) firm. These internships gave me a diverse set of
                    experiences in the industry. This was also a time when I had a realization inside me that I didn't
                    want to work in an operations plant. Looking at logbooks and doing safety checks of boiler vessels
                    was just not for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed my time at IIT, but I knew by the end that I didn't want to end up in the industry of
                    Mechanical Engineering. Consulting jobs were not too hot at the time, hence, I ended up working at a
                    Petroleum firm as a Sales Officer. Soon after joining the job, I knew that being a Sales Officer for
                    Petroleum products in Haryana was not my cup of tea. I worked at that firm for a total of six
                    months. You could say that the roots of the tree were obstructed to grow for a while.
                </p>

                <h3>Trunk</h3>
                <p>
                    After leaving my Sales Officer job, I moved to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore to work as
                    a Research Assistant. This wasn't my dream job. It paid less than half of what I was getting before.
                    However, I knew that I had to try something new to know where my interests lie and Research is
                    always new and interesting. During this time, I worked on an interdisciplinary project. I learned
                    about complex networks, graph algorithms, flame dynamics, and visibility graphs. These topics may
                    sound obscure to some but are quite interesting when you read about them. What mattered to me was
                    that I was learning something new and using that to finish the project. I developed an algorithm to
                    model turbulent flame front dynamics and wrote a research paper about the same. Presenting my work
                    at a conference among stalwarts of the field gave me immense confidence. The trunk was growing
                    stronger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my time at IISc, I decided to pursue a higher degree which would let me work while studying
                    and would fall under the category of computational engineering. By this time, I had enough knowledge
                    and skills in the field and was confident about my decision. The only problem was that there were
                    very few institutions that offered such a degree. Also, I wanted to pursue a Master's rather than a
                    Ph.D. as I wasn't too sure if I could give the time commitment that a Ph.D. demands. I applied for
                    seven different colleges for Masters in either Computer Science or Computational Engineering. One of
                    them was in Mechanical Engineering at UBC, Vancouver. The only reason I applied here was because of
                    Dr. Carl Ollivier Gooch and his Advanced Numerical Simulations Laboratory (ANSLab). Once accepted, I
                    was to work in the lab for the projects involving either simulation physics or mesh generation. The
                    lab and his work were quite popular and his rating
                    on [ratemyprofessor.com](http://ratemyprofessor.com/) is a staggering 4.8/5.0. Hence, when I
                    received an admit from UBC, Vancouver, it was a no-brainer for me to join and work with him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While at UBC, I took several Mathematics and Software Engineering courses. Some of them were online
                    while the others were offline. I got comfortable while working on a large codebase with a team of
                    about 5 people. I had time to focus on my shortcomings in becoming a good Software Engineer and
                    hence worked exactly on those. For example, I didn't have good knowledge of working with the Linux
                    operating system. However, the only operating system present in the lab for developers was Linux.
                    Hence, I got comfortable while working on Linux with experience. Projects in courses such as
                    Geometric Modelling and Digital Humans helped me work on Software Projects with a tight schedule.
                    Overall, the tree's trunk was growing stronger at this point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although everything during my Master's degree was working out well, the degree that I was pursuing
                    was still Mechanical Engineering. My project in the lab involved computational geometry and mesh
                    development. I was writing programs to develop meshes for the simulations team to simulate flow
                    fields, typically used in aerodynamics. However, I was officially pursuing a Mechanical Engineering
                    degree. This gave me qualms in my stomach for obvious reasons. After graduating, I would neither be
                    a suitable candidate for a Mechanical Engineering job nor for a Software Engineering job, I thought.
                    However, I knew that an internship in the Software Engineering field and enough preparation for job
                    search, I might as well crack the tech. Hence, I started applying for Software Engineering
                    Internship positions. I would have applied to more than a hundred positions. And can you guess how
                    many interviews I got? Zero. Yes, you read it right, I received zero interview opportunities from
                    all my applications. In the end, I was distraught and thought I would never be able to break into
                    this field. It isn't worth trying. This was like someone was trying to cut the trunk of the tree
                    while it was growing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One day, at the end of the Software Engineering Internship season, I came across an internship
                    opportunity for an organization whose codebase I was using, Computational Geometry Algorithms
                    Library, or CGAL. It was a summer internship sponsored by Google and well known as Google Summer of
                    Code. Taking a leap of faith, I got in touch with two of the mentors at CGAL who floated the
                    positions and wrote two proposals for the summer internship. I eventually got selected for one of
                    those. I was delighted and scared at the same time. I would be working in the tech sector industry
                    for the first time.
                </p>

                <h3>Branches</h3>
                <p>
                    The internship at CGAL taught me several things. I was working on another large codebase which was
                    written by professionals in the field of Computational Geometry. The codebase was almost immaculate.
                    This was the reason for my fear. What if my code ends up breaking things? What if I am not able to
                    complete my project in time? I acknowledged my fears and thought I should just jump right in and get
                    my hands dirty. Whatever happens, is fine, I still tried. Hence, I started making changes and
                    writing viewers for the data structures in the library. I learned template-metaprogramming concepts,
                    unit testing concepts, several kinds of encapsulation, and inheritance. Once, I got in the flow of
                    making changes in the repository, I started enjoying it. My mentor and other teammates were just
                    awesome and helped me along the way with their feedback and help. This internship helped me branch
                    out my skill set and made me more confident about working in the tech industry. I completed the
                    internship project successfully by meeting all the deadlines in my project proposal. The tree was
                    branching out to cover more and more real estate for its leaves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After my internship, I moved back to working on my thesis project and finished the remaining bits of
                    it. I started to write my thesis and conference paper. After finishing these two documents and
                    defending my thesis came the real challenge. Getting a job in the tech. The tree was waiting for sun
                    and water to bear its fruit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I graduated in May 2020, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was possibly the worst time to
                    graduate since the global economic meltdown in 2008. However, it didn't hinder my ambition to get a
                    job in the tech sector. Yes, there were far fewer opportunities available for me to apply to, but I
                    was happy that I would get a good time to prepare at home as everything outside was closed. Hence, I
                    started preparing for software engineering jobs. I planned to apply here and there in the first
                    month, ie, June, and mainly focus on Algorithms and Data Structures preparation. In July, I planned
                    to ramp up my applications, so as to schedule the interviews at the end of July and in August. The
                    preparation part was challenging yet fulfilling. I churned out solutions to over 230 questions in
                    Leetcode and gave about a dozen mock interviews to friends and other job seekers. With time, I felt
                    more and more confident in my abilities to clear interviews. I even bought a System Design Course
                    worth about $100 and learned numerous system design concepts to clear the minimum bar in the System
                    Design Interview.
                </p>

                <h3>Fruit</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the preparation part was fulfilling, I wasn't landing any job interviews. Given that the
                    competition for jobs was fierce and I didn't have a degree with Computer Science on it, this part
                    was similar to my software engineering internship applications phase. Cold systematic rejections
                    filled my inbox. In total, I received one response from a FAANG company (let's call it Alpha) and
                    two from big but non-FAANG companies (Beta and Gamma) and one medium size startup company (Psi). My
                    preparation from mid-June, the time when I was selected for an online coding test in company Alpha
                    was focused on clearing the onsite interviews of Alpha. I did the top Leetcode questions for Alpha,
                    solved System Design questions with a friend of mine working at Alpha, and wrote a dozen of my work
                    experiences tailored to questions asked by Alpha. This sort of preparation helped me overall and
                    gave me traction to keep moving forward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I bombed the interview at Psi, where I met with a difficult interviewer (says a rookie Software
                    Developer). I couldn't solve the problem he gave me simply and went on to write a long obscure piece
                    of code in an attempt to solve it. Rejection at this firm was no surprise to me. At Beta, I had two
                    onsite rounds, two hours each. Each round consisted of two interviews of one hour. Here, I was
                    confident in answering all the questions. I gave alternate solutions to problems, even extended my
                    solutions for a more general case in one of the interviews. I received a call from the HR of Beta
                    saying they are ready to give me an offer. However, I wanted to wait for Alpha's onsite round. At
                    Alpha, my onsite rounds got rescheduled two times, because of which Beta had to wait. Finally, I was
                    interviewed at Alpha. My onsite rounds went fairly well. I couldn't think of an obvious reason for
                    rejection. However, I was not selected for a role there because of my lack of experience in the
                    industry. I was disappointed but had company Beta's offer to fall back on. Hence, I patted myself on
                    the back and asked Beta for an offer in my range of expectations. Meanwhile, at Gamma, I have
                    completed two rounds of interviews and am currently waiting for an offer from their side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Negotiating for an offer from Beta, I was able to ask them for an offer that was towards the higher
                    end of what they usually offer a freshly graduate software engineer. I won't share my compensation
                    directly, but I can say that it is close to six figures. I was delighted to hear that I finally had
                    an offer to work in the tech industry. This was the fruit that the tree bore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I have structured my story in terms of a tree growth where I have sequentially placed
                    roots, trunk, branches and fruits, my progress in all four areas have complemented each other and
                    helped me become a better Software Developer. For example, at the time of my summer internship at
                    Google Summer of Code, I learned template metaprogramming, which is a core concept in C++.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The whole process of getting into software engineering from mechanical engineering took about five
                    years for me. I am not saying that it would take the same time for you. It might be less or more.
                    For me, a good part of those five years was just exploring different things to find out what I was
                    passionate about and liked doing. A candidate can prepare for a Software Engineering Interview
                    reasonably in less than six months, I believe. But, I don't think that amount of time is sufficient
                    for anyone to know whether this is the field that they want to be working in for the rest of their
                    lives. It takes time for a tree to grow and bear fruit. Similarly, it takes time to explore one's
                    interests and work in an area that interests him/her eventually.
