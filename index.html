				Hello! Thanks for visiting me at one corner of the world wide web :) I am a Master's student in Engineering the University of British Columbia. Presently, I am working on surface mesh development. In layman language, that means breaking bigger things or domains into smaller things. Basically, I try to break bigger things to smaller things so that it is convenient for another engineer to simulate something over that big domain. This involves a lot of numerical analysis, coding, insight into the problem at hand and creativity.
